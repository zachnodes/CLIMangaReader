# CLI Manga Reader Application Built With C# 

## Utilizing the MangaDex API, Spectre.Console, and .NET MAUI, this project is designed to allow users to search for and read their favourite manga series entirely from the terminal!

 Project Under Development

 Currently trying to figure out how to execute the MAUI interface from the console app once user finishes downloading desired chapter
 Due to [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/5975), will be switching to Winforms to continue prototyping project
